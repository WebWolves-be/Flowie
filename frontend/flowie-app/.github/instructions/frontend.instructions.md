# Frontend Development Guidelines
- Always use control flow syntax that is compatible with Angular and TypeScript best practices.
- Always use signals and the latest Angular 20 features.
- Ensure that all components, services, and models adhere to the established architecture of the Flowie frontend application.
- Follow the existing naming conventions for files, classes, and variables to maintain consistency across the codebase.
- When creating or modifying models, ensure they accurately represent the data structures used in the application and are properly typed.
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability, including appropriate commenting and documentation where necessary.
- Test all new features and changes thoroughly to ensure they work as intended and do not introduce regressions.
- When suggesting changes, consider the impact on performance and user experience, especially in components that handle data fetching and rendering.
